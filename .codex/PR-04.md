# PR-04 — Add fixtures layout + golden output normalizer for E2E

## Goal
Make adding tests fast by standardizing fixtures and expectations.

## Scope
Introduce fixture conventions and a small normalizer that strips unstable fields (timestamps, UUIDs, trace/span IDs).

## Implementation Plan
1) Create `fixtures/` layout:
   - `fixtures/packs/`
   - `fixtures/config/`
   - `fixtures/secrets/`
   - `fixtures/inputs/`
   - `fixtures/expected/`
2) Add Rust helper:
   - `Fixture::load_json(path)`
   - `Fixture::load_text(path)`
   - `normalize_json(Value) -> Value` removing:
     - timestamps
     - random IDs
     - trace/span IDs
     - any known unstable fields
3) Add a small test verifying normalization is stable.

## Files
- `fixtures/.keep` (or initial minimal content)
- `src/fixtures.rs`
- `tests/fixtures_normalize.rs`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Normalizer produces deterministic golden comparisons.
- Fixture loaders are used by at least one existing test.
