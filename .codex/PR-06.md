# PR-06 — E2E pack lifecycle test (build/verify/install) using real packc + deployer

## Goal
Prove end-to-end that:
- pack can be built (or loaded as fixture gtpack)
- verified
- installed into a running stack
- discoverable/usable by runner

## Scope
Add one “hello pack” fixture and a single test.

## Implementation Plan
1) Add fixture pack project OR fixture gtpack:
   - `fixtures/packs/hello/` (packc project) OR `fixtures/packs/hello.gtpack`
2) Add harness helpers:
   - `pack_build(path) -> gtpack`
   - `pack_verify(gtpack)`
   - `pack_install(tenant, gtpack)`
3) Add scenario test:
   - boot stack
   - install pack
   - verify install via API/log/registry
4) Record artifacts:
   - pack build output
   - verify output
   - install output

## Acceptance Criteria
- Test passes locally + CI.
- Failure produces actionable artifact bundle.

## Notes
If install requires store, stub local store or point to file-based store for test environment.
