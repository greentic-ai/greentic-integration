# PR-11 — CI wiring for E2E tiers + artifact upload on failure

## Goal
Make E2E tests usable continuously without slowing PRs:
- L0/L1 runs on PR
- L2 runs nightly (or workflow_dispatch)
- Always upload `target/e2e/**` on failure

## Scope
Add/modify GitHub Actions workflow(s).

## Implementation Plan
1) Add test tier tags:
   - naming convention: `e2e_l0_*`, `e2e_l1_*`, etc.
   - or cargo features: `--features e2e-l1`
2) PR workflow:
   - run `cargo test -p greentic-integration e2e_l0_` and L1
3) Nightly workflow:
   - run L2 suite
4) Upload artifacts:
   - `actions/upload-artifact` for `target/e2e`
   - include logs and observations
5) Add a short README table:
   - which tests belong to which tier

## Acceptance Criteria
- PR CI runs quickly and deterministically.
- Failures include logs/artifacts for debugging.
