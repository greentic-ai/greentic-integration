# PR-12 — Developer UX: one-command E2E runner + fast iterations

## Goal
Make it easy to run E2E locally:
- `./scripts/e2e.sh l1`
- supports `--focus <scenario>`
- prints paths to artifacts on fail

## Scope
A small script + docs.

## Implementation Plan
1) Add `scripts/e2e.sh`:
   - `l0|l1|l2` selection
   - optional `--focus` maps to test name filter
2) Add `RUST_LOG` defaults and helpful hints:
   - show how to preserve stack for debugging (`E2E_KEEP=1`)
3) Document in README.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Developer can run L1 suite quickly.
- Failures point to artifact folder and how to inspect logs.
