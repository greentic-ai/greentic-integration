# PR-17 — Greentic-dev E2E: multi-pack & regression harness

## Goal
Turn greentic-integration into a **long-lived regression harness** covering:
- multiple packs
- multiple flows
- shared components

## Scope
- Combine multiple packs in one workspace.
- Validate isolation and reuse.
- Prepare ground for future CI matrices.

## Test cases to add

### 1) Multiple packs, shared components
- Scaffold two packs in the same workspace.
- Both reference a shared component.
- Build both packs.
- Assert:
  - no conflicts
  - correct component resolution per pack.

### 2) Pack isolation
- Modify a component used by Pack A only.
- Rebuild Pack B.
- Assert:
  - Pack B output unchanged
  - no cross-pack leakage.

### 3) Regression runner
- Add a single entry-point test that:
  - runs all E2E scenarios (PR-13 → PR-17)
  - fails fast on first error
- Intended as:
  - nightly CI job
  - pre-release gate.

## Structure
- Add a `tests/e2e_regression.rs`
- Provide a README section:
  - “How to run greentic-dev E2E locally”

## Acceptance criteria
- greentic-integration now documents and enforces the full developer journey.
- New greentic-dev changes can be validated end-to-end by adding scenarios here.
