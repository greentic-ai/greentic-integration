description: |
  Capability map declaring what the real messaging provider supports versus the simulator.
  Any capability missing in the simulator must be explicitly documented under `downgrades`.

providers:
  messaging-primary:
    capabilities:
      - send_message
      - buttons
      - adaptive_cards
      - streaming
      - effect_log
  simulator:
    capabilities:
      - send_message
      - buttons
      - adaptive_cards
      - effect_log

downgrades:
  - capability: streaming
    reason: Deterministic simulator response stream runs synchronously, so streaming is disabled.
